Notes for plotting skew-Ts:

The procedure here is pretty simple:

1) Open the R GUI from the desktop (double click the big "R")

2) Run:
  skewt.csu()

(or even easier, this should be the last thing that was run, so click the "up" arrow once or twice.)

3) This will create a .png image in the E:\png_images folder


The Vaisala software will write the needed file out at 1, 2, 5, and then every subsequent 5 minutes after launch, so you can just repeat step #2 to get an updated skew-T as the balloon is rising.

Make sure to run this one last time once you've terminated the sounding to get the complete profile.

When you quit R, it doesn't really matter if you save the workspace or not (either selection is fine.)

If you run into problems, let Russ know -- we haven't fully tested this on the replacement system yet.



I tried getting the software to write out a file that can be read by SHARPpy too, but this isn't quite working yet.
