## Quality-Controlled (QCed) Upper-air Radiosonde Dataset

> [time=Jan 21, 2022]

---

### Introduction:

The QCed upper-air radiosonde dataset for PRECIP-2021 field campaign includes the data from the following radiosonde instruments during 5/1 to 8/19,

1. 52 Vaisala RS41-SGP upper-air sounding (50 co-launched with Storm Tracker; 2 solo).
2. 56 Storm Tracker upper-air sounding (50 co-launched with Vaisala RS41-SGP; 5 co-launched with iMET4; 1 solo).


### Dataset Naming Convention:

For each individual soudning (Vaisala RS41-SGP or Storm Tracker), the following levels of data will be generated,

* Level 0 (L0) - raw, original data, native resolution (usually 1Hz)
* Level 1 (L1) - data from all sites and instrument in a uniform, digital, easily readable format (native resolution)
* Level 2 (L2) - processed with automated QC checks (ASPEN) to remove bad data (native resolution)
* Level 3 (L3) - corrected (if possible and necessary; native resolution)
* Level 4 (L4) - uniform vertical resolution (with QC flags if possible)
    * L4u - uncorrected L4 version based on L2 data
    * L4c - corrected L4 version based on L3 data

For example, the data in the directory "L1_csv" are the Level 1 data in csv format.


### Current Status of Data:

The QCed upper-air radiosonde dataset for PRECIP-2021 field campaign has been generated to Level 4u. The current available file formats in each level include,

**1. For both Vaisala RS41 & Storm Tracker:**
* Level 0 (L0) - ascii (csv or txt) format
* Level 1 (L1) - csv format
* Level 2 (L2) - csv, eol, and netcdf formats (png files are the skew-T diagrams generated by ASPEN)
* Level 4 uncorrected (L4u) – csv format

**2. Specifically for Storm Tracker (additional levels with *Data Correction*):**
* Level 3 (L3) - csv and mat formats
* Level 4 corrected (L4c) – csv and mat formats
